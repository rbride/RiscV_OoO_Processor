# RiscV_OoO_Processor
And out of order processor project following the University of Michigan EECS 470 Coursework, from start to finish.

The purpose of this project is to not only follow the structure of the course and review material I have not seen in a while, but to test myself and see how quickly I can accomplish this task after my development as a RTL design engineer. The goal is to complete it in under 2 weeks. (Also to mog Chris Huggins)
